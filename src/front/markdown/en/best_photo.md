Photos can be taken using any photographing device.
Restrictions: size __no more than 200 MB__, format __JPEG, JPG__.

The highest accuracy of the determination will be achieved if the following conditions are met:

1. Take photos of an object on a plain light background (for example, on a sheet of white paper).
2. The insect should have a normal (natural) body shape and color, should not be covered with dirt, mold, etc.
3. The picture should be taken from above (the plane of the sensor is approximately parallel to the plane of the insect).
4. Try to avoid the appearance of sharp shadows in the image, as well as overexposure in the bright areas of the object.
This often happens when you take pictures in the bright sun (very contrasting lighting). To soften the light, the object can,
for example, be shielded from the sun with your body or be covered with a white sheet of thin paper, 
or any other translucent material.
5. Try to avoid blur. The image turns out to be blurry most often when shooting with hands in low-light conditions.
If there is little light (cloudy weather, shooting indoors), 
it is best to fix the camera or smartphone on a tripod, otherwise rest your elbows on the table 
or press the photographing device to a fixed support.
6. The image should take up most of the frame. When shooting with a camera, the best solution is to use
a macro lens (for example, Laowa 100/2.8 super macro 2:1). Photos taken with modern cameras
can be cropped quite a lot (up to 50%), while the image quality remains satisfactory.
When shooting on a smartphone, it is best to use macro lenses specially designed for these devices.
7. Try to focus on the front 1/3 of the pronotum. In this case, a large aperture value (see the next paragraph)
most of the insect's body will be in focus.
8. When shooting with a camera, if possible, try to take pictures with the maximum possible depth of field
(the aperture value on the lens is 1/10-1/16), or use focus stacking technology.
