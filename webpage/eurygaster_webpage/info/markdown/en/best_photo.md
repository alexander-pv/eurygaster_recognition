**Device and Format**. You can use any photo-capturing device. Just make sure that the image doesn't exceed 50 MB (ideally
10 MB). For quick uploads and optimal processing speed, we recommend uploading photos within these parameters: a size
between 1000 and 3000 pixels on the longer side, saved in either JPEG or JPG format, and with a quality setting of
8-10 (using Photoshop's quality scale).

**Background Matters**. Optimal identification accuracy is achieved with a single-toned, light background, such as a plain
sheet of white paper.

**Pristine Subjects**. Ensure that the insect has a natural body shape and coloring, free from dirt, mold, or any other
substances.

**The Right Angle**. Capture the image from above, ensuring that the sensor plane of your device is roughly parallel to the
insect's plane.

**Lighting**. When taking photos, avoid sharp shadows on the subject or overexposure in bright areas. Harsh shadows often
occur in strong sunlight (high-contrast lighting). To soften the light, you can shield the subject from the sun with
your body, or use a thin, white sheet of office paper or any other semi-transparent material.

**Blur prevention**. Prevent image blurriness, which often happens when shooting handheld in low-light conditions. If you
have insufficient light (cloudy weather or indoor shooting), it's best to mount your camera or smartphone on a tripod.
Otherwise, stabilize your device on a steady surface.

**Fill the Frame**. The subject should occupy a significant portion of the frame. You can use DSLR or mirrorless cameras,
whether full-frame or cropped sensor (APS-C or Micro 4/3). For best results, consider using a macro lens, such as the
Laowa 100mm f/2.8 2x Ultra Macro APO, Laowa 85mm f/5.6 2x Ultra Macro APO, Laowa 25mm f/2.8 2.5–5X Ultra Macro, or
similar options. However, modern cameras allow for substantial cropping (up to 50%) while maintaining image quality. For
smartphone photography, specialized macro lenses designed for these devices work best.

**Focus**. Aim to focus on the front 1/3 of the insect's dorsal side. This way, with a high aperture setting (see the next
point), a larger part of the insect's body will be in focus.

**Aperture and Depth of Field**. If using a camera, aim for the maximum possible depth of field, until image quality begins
to deteriorate due to diffraction effects (aperture value on the lens should be around f/14 to f/18), or utilize focus
stacking technology when available.
