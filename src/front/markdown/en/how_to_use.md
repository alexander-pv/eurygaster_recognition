Upload a photo to the suggested window in the __Model__ section. Then, two results of independent models will be displayed:

1. The confidence of the specimen to belong to the genus _Eurygaster_ ("1.000" = 100%).
2. The confidence distribution of the specimen to belong to each of the six species distributed on the territory of Russia
and neighboring countries.

The accuracy of the definition directly depends on the quality of the image and the angle.
How to take a photo that can be used to determine the species with the highest accuracy, read in
the __Getting accurate recognition__ section.

For fast loading and optimal detection speed, please upload photos with the following parameters:
size from 1000 to 3000 px on the long side, JPEG format, JPG with 8-10 quality (standard units for Photoshop).
