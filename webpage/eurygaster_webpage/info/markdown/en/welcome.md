Welcome!

This application was created to support accurate identification of species from the genus 
[Eurygaster](https://www.gbif.org/species/2079334) Laporte (Hemiptera: Scutelleridae). The system is based on machine learning technology 
utilizing convolutional neural networks specifically trained for this purpose. 
It evaluates the presence of an Eurygaster in an image and, upon detection, identifies its species. 
All uploaded images may subsequently be used to improve the quality of identification.

To begin, please register or log in using a third party account, then upload your image for analysis. 
Try to take the photo of the bug strictly from above and against a plain background. 
This will significantly improve the accuracy of identification.
