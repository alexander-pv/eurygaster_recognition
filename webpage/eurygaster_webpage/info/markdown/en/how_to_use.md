Using our app is simple. Just upload your photo into the **Identify Eurygaster** tab,
and you will receive two key insights:

* The likelihood that the specimen belongs to the genus Eurygaster ("1.000" = 100%).
* The likelihood that the specimen belongs to one of the six species commonly found in Russia and Western Asia.

Keep in mind that the accuracy of the identification depends on your photo's quality and the angle you have chosen for
your shot. If you want to capture a photo that leads to the most accurate species recognition, please consult the
**Getting accurate recognition** tab.
